    Two winters ago, I went to Europe with my family. We visited a few cities in
    Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, and Paris. One of the highlights of this
    trip was the christmas markets, which I visited every day. Each market in
    different city sell different food and souvenior, and I was always existed
    to discover what delicious food or exquisite items I might find next.
    Besides the good food, Salzsburg and Amsterdam were the cities I enjoyed the
    most during my trip.

          >Angelo's Pizzeria</a
        >
        is my favorite because they have the best pizza and strombolis I ever
        tried in US. In my opinioin, their food is better than a lot of high end
        restaurant, but the price is around two-thirds of what you's pay at
        those restaurant. The cozy atmosphere also adds to the experience,
        making it a great place to enjoy dinner with family or friends.

      My favorite food is nasi lemak, a malaysia traditional food commonly eaten
      for breaksfast or lunch. It consists of fragrant coconut rice, sambal
      (spicy chili paste), crispy anchovies, peanuts, and a boiled egg, and
      cucumber slices. Personally I would like milder sambal if I have it in the
      morning. Besides that, I also love pairing it with milk tea or ice coffee
      for a satisfying meal.
